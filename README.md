# ItemRecommendationModel
This project demonstrates a Fashion Recommendation System that suggests similar fashion images based on a selected input image. It leverages ResNet50, a powerful convolutional neural network (CNN), for feature extraction and utilizes the Nearest Neighbors algorithm to find and display the most visually similar images.
